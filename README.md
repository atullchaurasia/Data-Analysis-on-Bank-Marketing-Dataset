# Bank Marketing Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the "Bank Marketing" dataset to understand customer behavior and build a predictive model to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the bank marketing data, preprocess it, explore various features through data visualization, handle missing values, detect and treat outliers, and build predictive models to classify whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (`yes` or `no`). 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Bank Marketing" dataset, which contains 41,188 rows and 21 columns. The columns include various attributes related to the client's demographics, bank contact details, socio-economic context, and the response variable (`y`) indicating if the client subscribed to the term deposit.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values by replacing them with the mode of the respective columns.
- Treating outliers using the IQR method to set thresholds.
- Converting categorical variables to numerical format using one-hot encoding.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data distribution and relationships between different features. Various visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps are used to analyze the data and draw insights.

## Model Building

After preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, we build several machine learning models to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The following models are considered:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## Results

The performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics. Based on the evaluation, the model with the best performance is selected.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
